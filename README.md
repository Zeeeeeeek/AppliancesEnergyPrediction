# Appliances Energy Prediction

This project was developed as part of the *Research Methodologies* course of the University of Camerino.  
Its main objective is to **forecast energy consumption** based on historical data enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions regarding energy production, distribution, and usage.

We use the dataset [Appliances Energy Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/loveall/appliances-energy-prediction) from Kaggle.
